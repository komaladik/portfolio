            Project In Detail
        </h3>
        <p>
            To develop an Online Mentoring Management System to
            promote and encourage students to actively participate in
            academic activities. To develop a web-based system that will
            provide the necessary services and academic activities for
            students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project replaces the conventional and inconvenient method of clearing doubts in class which involves the mentors and students being physically present at the same time.
